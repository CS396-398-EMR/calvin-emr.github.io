       Calvin University Department of Nursing.

We’ve built a working database \n        to store, retrieve, and preserve changes to data submitted from different sources across the \n        webapp. In addition, we’ve successfully implemented a login system and the ability to request \n        a provider order in-app.\n      \n    \n\n    Our Team\n  \n  \n        \n          \n          \n            \n              {{dev.firstName}} {{dev.lastName}}\n            \n            \n              {{dev.degreeFirst}} in {{dev.majorFirst}}\n              {{dev.degreeSecond}} in {{dev.majorSecond}}\n              \n                \n                  with a minor in {{dev.minors}}\n                \n                 2\">\n                  with minors in {{dev.minors}}\n                \n              \n            \n            \n              \n                {{dev.degreeFirst}}\n                {{dev.degreeSecond}} in {{dev.majorSecond}}\n              \n            \n          \n          \n            Hobbies: {{dev.hobby}}\n            \n              Graduating on: {{dev.graduation.toDate().toDateString()}}\n            \n          \n          \n            Add Me on LinkedIn\n          \n          \n            \n              Calvin Directory\n            \n          \n        \n\n  \n  \n    \n      \n        \n          \n          \n            \n              {{dev.firstName}} {{dev.lastName}}\n            \n            \n              {{dev.degreeFirst}} in {{dev.majorFirst}}\n              {{dev.degreeSecond}} in {{dev.majorSecond}}\n              \n                \n                  with a minor in {{dev.minors}}\n                \n                 2\">\n                  with minors in {{dev.minors}}\n                \n              \n            \n          \n          \n            Hobbies: {{dev.hobby}}\n          \n          \n            Add Me on LinkedIn\n          \n        \n      \n    \n   -->\n\n\n    \n\n    \n                \n                    ./about-us.component.scss\n                \n                .wrapper {\n  height: 100%;\n  width: 100%;\n  flex-direction: column;\n}\n\n.about-section {\n  margin-top: 60px;\n  margin-bottom: 20px;\n  padding: 50px;\n  // padding-top: 60px;\n  width: 100%;\n  height: 75%;\n  // height: 75vh;\n  text-align: center;\n  background: linear-gradient( rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.3), \n  rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.3) ), \n    url('../../../assets/images/EHR_students_photo_2022-04-06.jpg');\n  // background-image: url(\"../../../assets/images/EHR_students_photo_2022-04-06.jpg\");\n  background-position: 50% 25% ;\n  background-size: cover;\n  color: white;\n}\n\n.about-section h1 {\n  text-shadow: 1px 1px 5px black;\n}\n\n.about-section p {\n  font-size: medium;\n  text-shadow: 1px 1px 5px black;\n  margin-left: 25%;\n  margin-right: 25%;\n}\n\n#about-us-description {\n  text-align: left;\n}\nhtml {\n  box-sizing: border-box;\n}\n\n*,\n*:before,\n*:after {\n  box-sizing: inherit;\n}\n\n.profile-picture{\n  display: block;\n  margin-left: auto;\n  margin-right: auto;\n  margin-top: 2rem;\n  margin-bottom: 2rem;\n\n  width: 200px;\n  border-radius: 50%;\n}\n\n#cs-dept {\n  text-decoration: none;\n  color: black;\n}\n\n#cs-dept:hover {\n  text-decoration: underline;\n}\n\n.vision-section {\n  width: 50vw;\n}\n.vision-section h1 {\n  text-align: center;\n}\n\nmat-card {\n  min-width: 250px;\n  width: 33%;\n  max-width: 400px;\n  margin-top: 2rem;\n}\nmat-card-content {\n  margin-left: 1rem;\n  margin-right: 1rem;\n}\n\n.flex-container{\n  display: flex;\n  flex-flow: row wrap;\n  justify-content: space-around;\n  padding: 0;\n  margin-left: 15%;\n  margin-right: 15%;\n  list-style: none;\n}\n\n.flex-items {\n  padding: 5px;\n}\n\n\n// mat-grid-list {\n//   margin-left: 15%;\n//   margin-right: 15%;\n//   display: flex;\n//   justify-content: space-evenly;\n// }\n\n.li-button {\n  display: flex;\n  flex-direction: column;\n  // padding: 8px;\n  // margin: 10%;\n  // cursor: pointer;\n  // width: 200px;\n}\n\n.li-button a:hover {\n  background-color: maroon;\n}\n\na {\n  text-decoration: none;\n}\n.mat-raised-button {\n  margin: 10px;\n}\n\n@media screen and (min-width: 1080px) {\n  #about-us-description {\n    text-align: center;\n  }\n}\n    \n\n    \n        \n        \n            \n                Legend\n            \n            \n                Html element\n            \n            \n                Component\n            \n            \n                Html element with directive\n            \n        \n    \n\n    \n\n\n\n\n\n\n        var COMPONENT_TEMPLATE = '      About Us          We are a group of four seniors at Calvin University in the Class of 2022 who         started this project for CS-396 & CS-398.

aims to reproduce enterprise EMR software at a fraction of the cost for the purpose of educating and training aspiring nurses.\nThe project was generated with Angular CLI version 12.2.6.\nContributing to the Project\nBefore you start writing code for the project, please read the Additional Documentation section of this documentation. Each of the Additional Documentation pages details an important aspect about the app: the entire tech stack, the frontend's data flow, and more. Reading these pages will hopefully give you a better sense of how to navigate our app and make changes accordingly.\nThe following section describes how to use the Angular CLI to build, serve, and test the app.\nThe Angular CLI\nDevelopment server\nRun ng serve for a dev server. Navigate to http://localhost:4200/. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.\nCode scaffolding\nRun ng generate component component-name to generate a new component. You can also use ng generate directive|pipe|service|class|guard|interface|enum|module.\nBuild\nRun ng build to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the dist/ directory.\nRunning unit tests\nRun ng test to execute the unit tests via Karma.\nRunning end-to-end tests\nRun ng e2e to execute the end-to-end tests via a platform of your choice. To use this command, you need to first add a package that implements end-to-end testing capabilities.\nFurther help\nTo get more help on the Angular CLI use ng help or go check out the Angular CLI Overview and Command Reference page.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                   \n    \n         results matching \"\"\n        \n    \n    \n        No results matching \"\"\n    \n\n"},"license.html":{"url":"license.html","title":"getting-started - license","body":"\n                   \n\nMIT License\nCopyright (c) 2021 EMR\nPermission is hereby granted, free of charge, to any person obtaining a copy\nof this software and associated documentation files (the \"Software\"), to deal\nin the Software without restriction, including without limitation the rights\nto use, copy, modify, merge, publish, distribute, sublicense, and/or sell\ncopies of the Software, and to permit persons to whom the Software is\nfurnished to do so, subject to the following conditions:\nThe above copyright notice and this permission notice shall be included in all\ncopies or substantial portions of the Software.\nTHE SOFTWARE IS PROVIDED \"AS IS\", WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR\nIMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO THE WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY,\nFITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE AND NONINFRINGEMENT.
