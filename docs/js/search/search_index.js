We are a group of four seniors at Calvin University in the Class of 2022 who started this project for CS-396 & CS-398.\n      The journey to create an Electronic Medical Record (EMR) began in the Fall of 2021 and is wrapping up in April 2022.\n    \n    Click the following to view our:\n    Presentation\n    Project\n      Proposal\n    Please sign in with your Calvin login to view our presentation slides and our project proposal\n    Our Sponsor\n    Calvin University Department of Computer Science\n  \n  \n    \n      Our Vision\n      By the start of the Fall 2022 semester, we want every nursing student at Calvin using our EMR.\n      Summary of Our Project\n      This semester we were given the opportunity to build an Electronic Medical Record (EMR) for the Calvin University

Summary of Our Project      This semester we were given the opportunity to build an Electronic Medical Record (EMR) for the Calvin University Department of Nursing. Our project partner, a professor of the nursing department, had specified that we needed to include the ability to request a provider order; have access to a Medical Administration Record; and a number of other smaller, equally important things.            The project is currently accessible online, hosted by Firebase. We’ve built a working database to store, retrieve, and preserve changes to data submitted from different sources across the webapp. In addition, we’ve successfully implemented a login system and the ability to request a provider order in-app.              Our Team                                                          {{dev.firstName}} {{dev.lastName}}

\n        Component to help manage multi-select form inputs. It generates a list\nof checkboxes, with each checkbox associated with an option and a FormControl\nthat takes a boolean value. The component is compatible with \"Set All WNL\" checkboxes,\nmeaning that if the checkbox group is specified to have a \"WNL\" option, it will\nenable/disable the other checkboxes if the \"WNL option is checked.\"\nTo see examples where this component is used, visit some of the classes that extend the\nAssessmentForm class (e.g. Neurological, Genitourinary, Musculoskeletal).\nNote: WNL = \"Within Normal Limits\"\n\n    \n\n\n    \n        Implements\n    \n    \n                    OnInit\n    \n\n\n\n    Metadata\n    \n        \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n            \n                selector\n                emr-checkbox-group\n            \n\n            \n                styleUrls\n                ./emr-checkbox-group.component.scss\n            \n\n\n\n            \n                templateUrl\n                ./emr-checkbox-group.component.html\n            \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n        \n    \n\n\n    \n    Index\n    \n        \n\n                \n                    \n                        Methods\n                    \n                \n                \n                    \n                        \n                            \n                                ngOnChanges\n                            \n                            \n                                ngOnInit\n                            \n                            \n                                toggleWNL\n                            \n                        \n                    \n                \n\n                \n                    \n                        Inputs\n                    \n                \n                \n                    \n                        \n                            \n                                default\n                            \n                            \n                                group\n                            \n                            \n                                hasWNL\n                            \n                            \n                                label\n                            \n                            \n                                options\n                            \n                            \n                                wnl\n                            \n                            \n                                wnlLabel\n                            \n                        \n                    \n                \n\n                \n                    \n                        Outputs\n                    \n                \n                \n                    \n                        \n                            \n                                wnlChange\n                            \n                        \n                    \n                \n\n\n\n        \n    \n\n\n    \n    Constructor\n        \n            \n                \n                    \nconstructor()\n                    \n                \n                        \n                            \n                                Defined in src/app/shared/emr-checkbox-group/emr-checkbox-group.component.ts:68\n                            \n                        \n\n            \n        \n\n\n    \n    Inputs\n        \n            \n                \n                    \n                        \n                        default\n                    \n                \n                \n                    \n                        Type :         any\n\n                    \n                \n                        \n                            \n                                    Defined in src/app/shared/emr-checkbox-group/emr-checkbox-group.component.ts:42\n                            \n                        \n                \n                    \n                        The value that should automatically fill the form input when \"Within Normal Limits\" (WNL)\nis checked.\n\n                    \n                \n            \n        \n        \n            \n                \n                    \n                        \n                        group\n                    \n                \n                \n                    \n                        Type :         FormGroup\n\n                    \n                \n                \n                    \n                        Default value : new FormGroup({})\n                    \n                \n                        \n                            \n                                    Defined in src/app/shared/emr-checkbox-group/emr-checkbox-group.component.ts:53\n                            \n                        \n                \n                    \n                        The FormGroup to render as checkboxes.

to the Project\nBefore you start writing code for the project, please read the Important section of this documentation. Each of the Important pages details an important aspect about the app: the entire tech stack, the frontend's data flow, and more. Reading these pages will hopefully give you a better sense of how to navigate our app and make changes accordingly.\nAdditionally, make sure to read up on the section of the EMR you plan to make changes on. For example, if you are looking to change the Nursing Assessment, read the documentation on the Assessment classes (e.g. Genitourinary, Gastrointestinal, etc.) and how they are used to send data to Firestore. The documentation for the classes and functions involved may have important tips on how to use them.\nThe following section describes how to use the Angular CLI to build, serve, and test the app.\nEnvironment Set-Up\nBefore you get started, make sure you have the following installed:\n\nGit\nNode.js and npm\nAngular CLI\n\nThe above should install without much issue on Linux and MacOS. If you are running Windows, see the Windows troubleshooting guide.\nNotes: \n\nIt is strongly recommended to install nvm to manage different versions of Node.js and npm. As of the time of writing, we use Node v14.19.1 (npm v6.14.16).\nWhen installing the Angular CLI, you may need to use sudo npm install -g @angular/cli.\n\n\nClone the application repo to your local machine:\n\ngit clone https://github.com/CS396-398-EMR/calvin-emr.git\nEnter into the calvin-emr directory:\n\ncd calvin-emr\nInstall all npm packages:\n\nnpm install\nServe the application!\n\nng serveWindows Troubleshooting\nAs mentioned in the Environment Set-Up section, you will need Git, Node.js, npm, and Angular CLI installed to build the project. However, these may not be easy to do on Windows. This section serves as a guide to setting up the environment on Windows.\nNode.js and npm\nIt is strongly recommended to install nvm to manage different versions of Node.js and npm. As of the time of writing, we use Node v14.19.1 (npm v6.14.16).\nOn Windows, we will use a similar (but not identical) package to nvm: nvm-windows. You can download the latest release here. Under the desired release, there should be an Assets dropdown. Under this dropdown is a zip file named nvm-setup.zip. Download this file, open it, and run the nvm-setup.exe file inside of it. Follow the installer instructions to configure the installation of nvm-windows on your local machine.\nNow you should have access to nvm on the command line! You will now need to download the correct version of nvm. Open the Command Prompt as Administrator. Enter the below line into the command line:\nnvm install 14.19.1 && nvm use 14.19.1You can now close the Administrator Command Prompt. To check that nvm-windows is using the correct version of Node, enter the following into the command line:\nnvm currentVerify that the version matches the one below.\nv14.19.1Node and npm are now ready for use in the EMR project!\nAngular CLI\nAfter installing nvm-windows, you should be able to run the below command in the Command Prompt:\nnpm install -g @angular/cliThis will install the Angular CLI and any dependencies associated with it.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                   \n    \n         results matching \"\"\n        \n    \n    \n        No results matching \"\"\n    \n\n"},"license.html":{"url":"license.html","title":"getting-started - license","body":"\n                   \n\nMIT License\nCopyright (c) 2021 EMR\nPermission is hereby granted, free of charge, to any person obtaining a copy\nof this software and associated documentation files (the \"Software\"), to deal\nin the Software without restriction, including without limitation the rights\nto use, copy, modify, merge, publish, distribute, sublicense, and/or sell\ncopies of the Software, and to permit persons to whom the Software is\nfurnished to do so, subject to the following conditions:\nThe above copyright notice and this permission notice shall be included in all\ncopies or substantial portions of the Software.\nTHE SOFTWARE IS PROVIDED \"AS IS\", WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR\nIMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO THE WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY,\nFITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE AND NONINFRINGEMENT.

The Cloud Functions run automatically in the backend based on certain triggers. We write their code in the functions directory and then compile and deploy them to Firebase. See the Workflow page for more information on deploying Cloud Functions.\nThe source code for these functions is contained in the functions/src/index.ts file.\nRead more about Firebase Cloud Functions here.\ncreateUser\nParameters:\n\ndata: object passed to the function. This object must contain an user field to store the User object that will be used to specify the new account's information.\ncontext: object containing authentication information.\n\nFunction that creates an account with the data contained in data.user. The account configuration is specified as follows:\n\nuid: the account's ID\nemail: the account's email\npassword: composed of the account's email prefix and the account's ID\ndisplayName: the account's first name and last name\ndisabled: false\n\nThe function then creates the corresponding User document in Firestore with the account ID as the document ID. The information in the document is taken from data.user.\nThis function will not run if the user calling it is not authenticated.\ndeleteUser\nParameters:\n\ndata: object passed to the function. This object needs to contain an id field to store the ID of the user/account to delete.\ncontext: object containing authentication information.\n\nFunction that deletes the account specified by data.id. This function will not run if the user calling it is not authenticated.\nuserDeleted\nTrigger that runs each time a user's authentication account is deleted. The function takes the ID from the deleted account and uses it to delete the corresponding User document in Firestore.\n\n                   \n    \n         results matching \"\"\n        \n    \n    \n        No results matching \"\"\n    \n\n"},"additional-documentation/angular-cli.html":{"url":"additional-documentation/angular-cli.html","title":"additional-page - Angular CLI","body":"\n                   \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Angular CLI\nDevelopment server\nRun ng serve for a dev server. Navigate to http://localhost:4200/. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.\nCode scaffolding\nRun ng generate component component-name to generate a new component. You can also use ng generate directive|pipe|service|class|guard|interface|enum|module.\nBuild\nRun ng build to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the dist/ directory.\nRunning unit tests\nRun ng test to execute the unit tests via Karma.\nRunning end-to-end tests\nRun ng e2e to execute the end-to-end tests via a platform of your choice. To use this command, you need to first add a package that implements end-to-end testing capabilities.\nFurther help\nTo get more help on the Angular CLI use ng help or go check out the Angular CLI Overview and Command Reference page.\n\n                   \n    \n         results matching \"\"\n        \n    \n    \n        No results matching \"\"\n    \n\n"},"additional-documentation/deployment.html":{"url":"additional-documentation/deployment.html","title":"additional-page - Deployment","body":"\n                   \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDeployment\nDeploying to Firebase Hosting\nThe Calvin EMR web application is hosted live on Firebase Hosting at https://calvin-emr.web.app. The app is configured with Firebase's GitHub Action feature for continuous deployment. The live site is built and deployed off of the main branch in our GitHub repository. Firebase also generates a live preview site for each pull request that is made. It is recommended to look at the pull request's preview before merging into the main branch, since the live preview shows what the actual site will look like after merging.\nAfter a branch is merged into main, Firebase automatically builds and deploys the updated application.\nYou can read more about Firebase Hosting here.\nDeploying Cloud Functions\nThe application uses Firebase Cloud Functions to handle user account creation and deletion. You can read more about Firebase Cloud Functions here.\nTo deploy the Cloud Functions, run the following command:\nfirebase deploy --only functionsThis will run a linter on the files containing the function code to ensure the code is formatted correctly. This check may fail, so be sure to fix all errors that are displayed in the console before running the command again (luckily, the errors are pretty informational).\nAfter the code passes the formatting test, it will be packaged and deployed to Firebase. You can view the functions and the function logs under the Functions tab in the Firebase project.\n\n                   \n    \n         results matching \"\"\n        \n    \n    \n        No results matching \"\"\n    \n\n"}}
