We’ve built a working database \n        to store, retrieve, and preserve changes to data submitted from different sources across the \n        webapp. In addition, we’ve successfully implemented a login system and the ability to request \n        a provider order in-app.\n      \n    \n\n    Our Team\n  \n  \n        \n          \n          \n            \n              {{dev.firstName}} {{dev.lastName}}\n            \n            \n              {{dev.degreeFirst}} in {{dev.majorFirst}}\n              {{dev.degreeSecond}} in {{dev.majorSecond}}\n              \n                \n                  with a minor in {{dev.minors}}\n                \n                 2\">\n                  with minors in {{dev.minors}}\n                \n              \n            \n            \n              \n                {{dev.degreeFirst}}\n                {{dev.degreeSecond}} in {{dev.majorSecond}}\n              \n            \n          \n          \n            Hobbies: {{dev.hobby}}\n            \n              Graduating on: {{dev.graduation.toDate().toDateString()}}\n            \n          \n          \n            Add Me on LinkedIn\n          \n          \n            \n              Calvin Directory\n            \n          \n        \n\n  \n  \n    \n      \n        \n          \n          \n            \n              {{dev.firstName}} {{dev.lastName}}\n            \n            \n              {{dev.degreeFirst}} in {{dev.majorFirst}}\n              {{dev.degreeSecond}} in {{dev.majorSecond}}\n              \n                \n                  with a minor in {{dev.minors}}\n                \n                 2\">\n                  with minors in {{dev.minors}}\n                \n              \n            \n          \n          \n            Hobbies: {{dev.hobby}}\n          \n          \n            Add Me on LinkedIn\n          \n        \n      \n    \n   -->\n\n\n    \n\n    \n                \n                    ./about-us.component.scss\n                \n                .wrapper {\n  height: 100%;\n  width: 100%;\n  flex-direction: column;\n}\n\n.about-section {\n  margin-top: 60px;\n  margin-bottom: 20px;\n  padding: 50px;\n  // padding-top: 60px;\n  width: 100%;\n  height: 75%;\n  // height: 75vh;\n  text-align: center;\n  background: linear-gradient( rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.3), \n  rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.3) ), \n    url('../../../assets/images/EHR_students_photo_2022-04-06.jpg');\n  // background-image: url(\"../../../assets/images/EHR_students_photo_2022-04-06.jpg\");\n  background-position: 50% 25% ;\n  background-size: cover;\n  color: white;\n}\n\n.about-section h1 {\n  text-shadow: 1px 1px 5px black;\n}\n\n.about-section p {\n  font-size: medium;\n  text-shadow: 1px 1px 5px black;\n  margin-left: 25%;\n  margin-right: 25%;\n}\n\n#about-us-description {\n  text-align: left;\n}\nhtml {\n  box-sizing: border-box;\n}\n\n*,\n*:before,\n*:after {\n  box-sizing: inherit;\n}\n\n.profile-picture{\n  display: block;\n  margin-left: auto;\n  margin-right: auto;\n  margin-top: 2rem;\n  margin-bottom: 2rem;\n\n  width: 200px;\n  border-radius: 50%;\n}\n\n#cs-dept {\n  text-decoration: none;\n  color: black;\n}\n\n#cs-dept:hover {\n  text-decoration: underline;\n}\n\n.vision-section {\n  width: 50vw;\n}\n.vision-section h1 {\n  text-align: center;\n}\n\nmat-card {\n  min-width: 250px;\n  width: 33%;\n  max-width: 400px;\n  margin-top: 2rem;\n}\nmat-card-content {\n  margin-left: 1rem;\n  margin-right: 1rem;\n}\n\n.flex-container{\n  display: flex;\n  flex-flow: row wrap;\n  justify-content: space-around;\n  padding: 0;\n  margin-left: 15%;\n  margin-right: 15%;\n  list-style: none;\n}\n\n.flex-items {\n  padding: 5px;\n}\n\n\n// mat-grid-list {\n//   margin-left: 15%;\n//   margin-right: 15%;\n//   display: flex;\n//   justify-content: space-evenly;\n// }\n\n.li-button {\n  display: flex;\n  flex-direction: column;\n  // padding: 8px;\n  // margin: 10%;\n  // cursor: pointer;\n  // width: 200px;\n}\n\n.li-button a:hover {\n  background-color: maroon;\n}\n\na {\n  text-decoration: none;\n}\n.mat-raised-button {\n  margin: 10px;\n}\n\n@media screen and (min-width: 1080px) {\n  #about-us-description {\n    text-align: center;\n  }\n}\n    \n\n    \n        \n        \n            \n                Legend\n            \n            \n                Html element\n            \n            \n                Component\n            \n            \n                Html element with directive\n            \n        \n    \n\n    \n\n\n\n\n\n\n        var COMPONENT_TEMPLATE = '      About Us          We are a group of four seniors at Calvin University in the Class of 2022 who         started this project for CS-396 & CS-398.

to the Project\nBefore you start writing code for the project, please read the Additional Documentation section of this documentation. Each of the Additional Documentation pages details an important aspect about the app: the entire tech stack, the frontend's data flow, and more. Reading these pages will hopefully give you a better sense of how to navigate our app and make changes accordingly.\nAdditionally, make sure to read up on the section of the EMR you plan to make changes on. For example, if you are looking to change the Nursing Assessment, read the documentation on the Assessment classes (e.g. Genitourinary, Gastrointestinal, etc.) and how they are used to send data to Firestore. The documentation for the classes and functions involved may have important tips on how to use them.\nThe following section describes how to use the Angular CLI to build, serve, and test the app.\nThe Angular CLI\nDevelopment server\nRun ng serve for a dev server. Navigate to http://localhost:4200/. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.\nCode scaffolding\nRun ng generate component component-name to generate a new component. You can also use ng generate directive|pipe|service|class|guard|interface|enum|module.\nBuild\nRun ng build to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the dist/ directory.\nRunning unit tests\nRun ng test to execute the unit tests via Karma.\nRunning end-to-end tests\nRun ng e2e to execute the end-to-end tests via a platform of your choice. To use this command, you need to first add a package that implements end-to-end testing capabilities.\nFurther help\nTo get more help on the Angular CLI use ng help or go check out the Angular CLI Overview and Command Reference page.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                   \n    \n         results matching \"\"\n        \n    \n    \n        No results matching \"\"\n    \n\n"},"license.html":{"url":"license.html","title":"getting-started - license","body":"\n                   \n\nMIT License\nCopyright (c) 2021 EMR\nPermission is hereby granted, free of charge, to any person obtaining a copy\nof this software and associated documentation files (the \"Software\"), to deal\nin the Software without restriction, including without limitation the rights\nto use, copy, modify, merge, publish, distribute, sublicense, and/or sell\ncopies of the Software, and to permit persons to whom the Software is\nfurnished to do so, subject to the following conditions:\nThe above copyright notice and this permission notice shall be included in all\ncopies or substantial portions of the Software.\nTHE SOFTWARE IS PROVIDED \"AS IS\", WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR\nIMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO THE WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY,\nFITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE AND NONINFRINGEMENT.

configured with Firebase's GitHub Action feature for continuous deployment. The live site is built and deployed off of the main branch in our GitHub repository. Firebase also generates a live preview site for each pull request that is made. It is recommended to look at the pull request's preview before merging into the main branch, since the live preview shows what the actual site will look like after merging.\nAfter a branch is merged into main, Firebase automatically builds and deploys the updated application.\nYou can read more about Firebase Hosting here.\nDeploying Cloud Functions\nThe application uses Firebase Cloud Functions to handle user account creation and deletion. You can read more about Firebase Cloud Functions here.\nTo deploy the Cloud Functions, run the following command:\nfirebase deploy --only functionsThis will run a linter on the files containing the function code to ensure the code is formatted correctly. This check may fail, so be sure to fix all errors that are displayed in the console before running the command again (luckily, the errors are pretty informational).\nAfter the code passes the formatting test, it will be packaged and deployed to Firebase. You can view the functions and the function logs under the Functions tab in the Firebase project.\nGenerating Documentation\nThe documentation that you are currently looking at was generated using Compodoc. All files are located in the documentation and markdown directories.\nBuilding the Documentation Site\nThe documentation is compiled manually via npm scripts. The scripts are described below: \n\nnpm run compodoc:build: builds (or rebuilds) the static site that contains all documentation. Stores the site's files into a folder named documentation. Documentation is generated based on (1) JSDoc comments in the source code and (2) Markdown files in the markdown directory. See below for more information on both directories.\n\nnpm run compodoc:serve: serves the generated documentation site on the local machine.\n\nnpm run compodoc:build-and-serve: builds and serves the documentation site in sequence.\n\n\nImportant: If you have changed and built the documentation in a separate branch off main and are looking to make a pull request, make sure to delete the documentation folder from your branch before creating a pull request. Otherwise, the pull request will generate several merge conflicts that take significant time to resolve. To prevent this from happening:\n\nDelete the documentation directory from your branch.\nCreate and merge the pull request.\nRun npm compodoc:build to build your new documentation in the main branch.\n\ndocumentation Directory\nThe static site is served from this directory. This directory and its files are generated each time npm run compodoc:build and npm run compodoc:build-and-serve are run. The two commands rebuild the documentation site based on the JSDoc comments and tags in the src folder, as well as Markdown files specified in the markdown directory. As a result, do not place any additional files in this directory. They will be overwritten the next time the documentation is generated.\nIf you need to extend the documentation, reference the markdown directory section below.\nmarkdown Directory\nThis is the directory to put all .md files that you wish to include under the Additional Documentation tab in the final static site. This directory contains the summary.json file, which specifies which Markdown files to compile and display in the final documentation. All of the .md files listed in summary.json should be placed in the markdown directory.\nYou can read more about using the Additional Documentation tab here.\n\n                   \n    \n         results matching \"\"\n        \n    \n    \n        No results matching \"\"\n    \n\n"},"additional-documentation/data-flow.html":{"url":"additional-documentation/data-flow.html","title":"additional-page - Data Flow","body":"\n                   \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nStructure and Flow\nSystem Data Flow\n\nFrontend Data Flow\n\n\n                   \n    \n         results matching \"\"\n        \n    \n    \n        No results matching \"\"\n    \n\n"},"additional-documentation/special-components.html":{"url":"additional-documentation/special-components.html","title":"additional-page - Special Components","body":"\n                   \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSpecial Components\nThe app utilizes several reusable components to minimize the amount of code that needed to be written. Created to be reusable, these components may be more complex and less intuitive than others that are only used once. They are described in the sections below.\nemr-table\n\n                   \n    \n         results matching \"\"\n        \n    \n    \n        No results matching \"\"\n    \n\n"},"additional-documentation/cloud-functions.html":{"url":"additional-documentation/cloud-functions.html","title":"additional-page - Cloud Functions","body":"\n                   \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCloud Functions\nThe application uses Firebase Cloud Functions to handle user account creation and deletion. The Cloud Functions run automatically in the backend based on certain triggers. We write their code in the functions directory and then compile and deploy them to Firebase. See the Workflow page for more information on deploying Cloud Functions.\nThe source code for these functions is contained in the functions/src/index.ts file.\nRead more about Firebase Cloud Functions here.\ncreateUser\nParameters:\n\ndata: object passed to the function. This object must contain an user field to store the User object that will be used to specify the new account's information.\ncontext: object containing authentication information.\n\nFunction that creates an account with the data contained in data.user. The account configuration is specified as follows:\n\nuid: the account's ID\nemail: the account's email\npassword: composed of the account's email prefix and the account's ID\ndisplayName: the account's first name and last name\ndisabled: false\n\nThe function then creates the corresponding User document in Firestore with the account ID as the document ID. The information in the document is taken from data.user.\nThis function will not run if the user calling it is not authenticated.\ndeleteUser\nParameters:\n\ndata: object passed to the function. This object needs to contain an id field to store the ID of the user/account to delete.\ncontext: object containing authentication information.\n\nFunction that deletes the account specified by data.id. This function will not run if the user calling it is not authenticated.\nuserDeleted\nTrigger that runs each time a user's authentication account is deleted. The function takes the ID from the deleted account and uses it to delete the corresponding User document in Firestore.\n\n                   \n    \n         results matching \"\"\n        \n    \n    \n        No results matching \"\"\n    \n\n"}}
